## Application Overview

The Class Allocation System is a web-based application designed for a tuition center to streamline the process of class management and communication between administrators, tutors, parents, and students. Built using a modern technology stack that includes HTML, CSS, Flask, AJAX, jQuery, Bootstrap, and SQLite, the system offers a responsive, secure, and user-friendly platform.
