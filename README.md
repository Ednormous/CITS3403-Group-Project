## Requirements

In this project, participants are tasked with developing a request forum application. This application should enable users to:
- Create accounts
- Post their own requests
- Respond to requests posted by others

The concept of a "request" can be interpreted broadly. Potential implementations could include:
- **Puzzle Requests**: Users can post puzzles as requests for others to solve, with leaderboards tracking performance.
- **RPG-style Quests**: Users can create quests related to an existing game, with rewards offered upon completion.
- **LLM Prompt Requests**: Users can request optimal prompts for large language models (LLMs) to achieve specific goals.
- **NFT-like Image Marketplace**: Users can trade automatically generated images in a buy/sell format, simulating an NFT marketplace without actual cryptocurrency involvement.
- **Local Community Board**: A platform for users to offer or request favours from their neighbours.

### Design Considerations

Your application should be:
- **Engaging**: Aesthetically pleasing with a focus on highlighting key elements.
- **Effective**: Adds value by providing information, entertainment, or fostering community.
- **Intuitive**: Easy to navigate for a seamless user experience.

### Application Views

The application must include several user interfaces:
- **Introductory View**: Introduces the application, allowing for account creation or login.
- **Find Requests View**: Enables users to search for and accept requests.
- **Create Requests View**: Allows users to post new requests.

### Technical Requirements

The project must utilize the following technologies:
- HTML
- CSS
- Flask
- AJAX
- JQuery
- Bootstrap
- SQLite

Use of additional technologies or frameworks requires approval from the unit coordinator.

### GitHub Repository

Your project must be developed within a private GitHub repository containing:
- A `README.md` file that includes:
  - An application overview, detailing its design and functionality.
  - A group member table with UWA ID, name, and GitHub username for each member.
  - A brief summary of the application architecture.
  - Launch instructions.
  - Test running instructions.
- A `deliverables` folder containing three screen-capture videos or images, showcasing progress in line with Agile methodology. Each file should correspond to a Git tag marking the commit where the deliverable was created.
